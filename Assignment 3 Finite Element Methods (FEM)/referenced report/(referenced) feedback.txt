Feedback for FEM Report from Professor:
3/5
Feedback:
  
Good cover, detailed intro, good presentation of updated model, 
good presentation of FEM models (what were forces, position in 
simulation and directions?), triangle part has no forces in 
picture, good results table (but show also result pictures), 
good different shape testing for one part, what was optimized 
dimension in triangle part?, good MBS rerun, detailed validation 
chapter, good discussion (perhaps too much what was done vs what 
was learned)
