Good cover, good intro, detailed component selection, good material selection, perhaps show lifetime calculation method here?, 
nice CAD update and mechanism rendering, good requirements met chapter, detailed process chapter, detailed cost estimate, 
good BOM (missing bearings), detailed learning outcomes, good video (perhaps hide those skeleton sketches?)
