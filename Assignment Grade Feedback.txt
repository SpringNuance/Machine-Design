Feedback comments	
Intro OK, material selection not needed yet and causes confusion, good machine picture, in methods usually how the work was done is presented - 
not results like requirements, good requirements (is it max load capacity?), good operation principle pictures, detailed FBD, short discussion, 
no learning outcomes, no group working rules, good references

Feedback comments	
Good intro, good kutzbach (perhaps mark joints better in the picture - now little hard to see), detailed skeleton presentation (perhaps also show 
the joint types in the picture - yes, they should be the same as in kutzbach, but just to make it clear), Figure 5 is same as Figure 4, no presentation 
of actuator and its values with kinematic simulation, detailed presentation of dynamic simulation model and parts, good presentation of joint movement 
and velocities (perhaps show locations in the same x-y graph?), why only Z force graphs?, show max/min forces with table, joint 4 torque was only needed 
but good presentation of all of them), good power calculation, good animation (perhaps hide coord sys?), validation chapter quite short (tell how 
you could check that your motion simulations are correct), learning outcomes own sentence ends in the middle?, good learning outcomes, ok references


FEM Report

Feedback comments	
Good intro (different phases are more methods), good presentation of updated CAD models, good presentation of meshes, good presentation of FEM models, 
good results and summary table, good testing of different shapes, detailed presentation of optimization study (goal was weight and not stress?), good 
rerun of MBS (interesting change in the results - perhaps original was missing load from oil?),  good validation chapter, good learning outcomes

Feedback comments	
Good intro, detailed bearing selection, actuator not selected (only bearing for it?), good lubricant selection, good material selection, good lifetime 
estimate, good renderings, good requirements met discussion, detailed design process discussion, good cost estimate, BOM is missing selected components, 
good video, good discussion and learning outcomes
