Feedback for MBS Report from Professor:
4/5
good cover (perhaps add a date?), good intro, good kutzbach, 
what kind of joints are where?, good skeleton model presentation, 
what is rotational speed?, detailed dynamic model presentation 
(external force?), don't plot zeros (like first result graph), 
good location and velocity graphs, good force plots 
(perhaps add a summary table?), good power calculation, 
good validation discussion, good discussion, 
why not exported video?
